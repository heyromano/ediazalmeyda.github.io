As an Assistant Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu){:target="_blank"}, my courses and laboratories are inquiry-based and emphasize critical thinking, teamwork, and ethical engagement. In my teaching, I utilize local fieldwork components and connect course content with local and global challenges.

Across my courses, the central aims of my teaching include:
- Empowering students to engage the scientific method by nurturing their personal interests to develop and test their own hypotheses.
- Supporting lifelong learning by having students read, interpret, and communicate about peer-reviewed journal articles and other primary literature.
- Inspiring ethical engagement and action at local and global levels by connecting course content with real-world challenges.
- Learning to navigate collaboration and teamwork by including group activities and projects.
