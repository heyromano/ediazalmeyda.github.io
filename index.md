## Assistant Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies

At [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/division-of-natural-sciences/biology/){:target="_blank"}, I investigate how microbes contribute to maintaining biodiversity and respond to anthropogenic input in marine and agricultural settings.

The interaction between microbes and other species is increasingly recognized as essential to understanding and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, a central aim of conservation biology. My question-focused research spans two systems where the role of microbes is highly evident: coral reef ecosystems and agroecological systems. I utilize laboratory and fieldwork approaches to address significant challenges in conservation, including coral bleaching, soil depletion, food insecurity, species extinction, and ecosystem collapse. Outreach and partnering with community stakeholders are central to my work.

  Hello, world! this is just a sample **intro text**. You would normally put your [full name](about/) here and say something *smart* about yourself.

  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff.

  But after all this is your site and I'm just a **placeholder text** so what would i know about some *home page content*.
