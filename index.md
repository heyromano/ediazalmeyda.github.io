At [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/division-of-natural-sciences/biology/){:target="_blank"}, I investigate how microbes contribute to maintaining biodiversity and respond to anthropogenic input in marine and agricultural settings.

The interaction between microbes and other species is [increasingly recognized](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.2448){:target="_blank"} as essential to understanding and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. My question-focused research spans two systems where the role of microbes is highly evident: **coral reef ecosystems** and **agroecological systems**. I utilize laboratory and fieldwork approaches to address significant ecological challenges, including coral bleaching, soil depletion, food insecurity, species extinction, and ecosystem collapse. Outreach and partnering with community stakeholders are central to my work.
