I am a microbial ecologist at [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/division-of-natural-sciences/biology/){:target="_blank"}, a public liberal arts honors college in Sarasota, Florida.

In **coral reef ecosystems** and **agroecological systems**, I investigate the biodiversity of mutualisms and their adaptation in response to anthropogenic stressors. The interactions between microbes and other species are [increasingly recognized](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.2448){:target="_blank"} as essential to understanding and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. My question-driven research focuses on mutualistic interactions between animal-algal and plant-microbe systems. I utilize both laboratory and fieldwork approaches to address significant challenges in conservation, including coral bleaching, soil depletion, food insecurity, species extinction, and ecosystem collapse. A broader goal of my research is to inform the [“Ridge to Reef”](https://www.iucn.org/theme/water/our-work/current-projects/ridge-reef){:target="_blank"} movement, which aims to manage water from the terrestrial source to the sea. Outreach and partnering with community stakeholders are central to my work.
